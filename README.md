##Description

This challenge consists of a website that has HTML code (tags) with non-semantic elements. The following changes are made:

- I have edited the HTML code with non-semantic elements (<div> and <span>) such that only semantic elements are used.

- I have added comments to the HTML and CSS code so it is easy for the user to understand what each section is doing.

- I have arranged the code and applied indents or tabs so the code is easily readable.

- I have added accessible "alt" attributes to image elements.

- I have a concise and descriptive title to the title element.

- I have removed the "div" element from the unordered list in the navigation bar in the HTML file and modified the CSS file where the div class was referred.
